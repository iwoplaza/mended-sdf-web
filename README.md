## What does it do?

It upscales an image by a factor of $4$ (1K â†’ 4K, etc.) with a minimal hit to performance.
For the renderer implemented in the official example, it produces a $2024\times2024$ image ~12 times faster than targeting $2024\times2024$ directly.

## Ethical?

The dataset that was used to train the upscaling neural network was generated with Blender's Geometry Nodes. **No artist's work was used in the process**.

## Development

### Local setup

- Install Node.js
- Install pnpm
- Run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `pnpm dev` to run the development server, making the web app available via the web browser.
